    "**Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data (data that represents categories or labels) into a numerical format that can be processed and used by machine learning algorithms. Categorical data can't be directly used as input for many algorithms, as they require numerical values to perform calculations and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is useful in data science for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm Compatibility: Many machine learning algorithms, such as regression, neural networks, and decision trees, require numerical input. Encoding allows you to convert categorical data into a format that these algorithms can work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Representation: Data encoding helps in representing categorical features effectively, ensuring that they contribute appropriately to the model's understanding of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced Memory Usage: Numerical encoding often requires less memory compared to storing large sets of text labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Model Performance: Proper encoding can improve model performance by enabling algorithms to better capture underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Ordinal Data: Encoding techniques can handle ordinal data (categories with a meaningful order) appropriately, preserving the relationships between different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: Encoding ensures that the data remains consistent and can be easily compared across different observations."

    "**Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, two common techniques for encoding categorical variables are Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding. Let me provide you with a correct explanation and example for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Label encoding involves assigning a unique integer value to each category in a categorical variable. This encoding is suitable for categorical variables with an ordinal relationship, where categories have a specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original data: [\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\", \"Low\", \"Medium\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoded: [0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding: One-hot encoding transforms each category in a categorical variable into a binary column. Each column represents the presence or absence of a specific category. This method is suitable for nominal categorical variables where there is no inherent order among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original data: [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Orange\", \"Apple\", \"Orange\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoded:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apple: [1, 0, 0]\n",

    "Banana: [0, 1, 0]\n",

    "**Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when dealing with categorical variables that exhibit a high cardinality, meaning they have a large number of unique categories. One-hot encoding can lead to a significant increase in the number of features, which can negatively impact model training time and require more memory. In such cases, nominal encoding provides a more compact representation of the categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a scenario where you're working on a text classification task where each document is tagged with a specific topic. You have a categorical variable \"Topic\" that represents the topic of each document. This categorical variable has a high cardinality because there are many unique topics across the documents.\n",

    "For a categorical variable with 5 unique values, I would choose to use **One-Hot Encoding** to transform the data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding is suitable when the categorical variable has a relatively small number of unique values, such as 5 in this case. Each unique value is transformed into a binary column, and this technique is efficient and effective when dealing with a limited number of categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are only 5 unique values, creating binary columns for each value won't lead to an excessive increase in the number of features, making it a straightforward and manageable approach. Each binary column represents the presence or absence of a specific category, which helps machine learning algorithms to treat each category independently without assuming any ordinal relationship.\n",

    "   - **Contract Type**: Check if \"contract type\" has an ordinal relationship. For example, if it's \"Month-to-month,\" \"One year,\" \"Two year,\" and there's a clear order, you can assign numerical labels (e.g., 0, 1, 2) based on the order. If there's no clear order, consider treating it as nominal and using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **One-Hot Encoding (if applicable)**:\n",
    "   - **Gender**: If \"gender\" has more than two categories (e.g., \"Male,\" \"Female,\" \"Other\"), use one-hot encoding to create binary columns for each category. For instance, create columns \"Male,\" \"Female,\" \"Other\" where each column holds 1 or 0 based on the presence of that category.\n",
    "   - **Contract Type**: If \"contract type\" is treated as nominal or if it wasn't suitable for label encoding, use one-hot encoding to create binary columns for each contract type category.\n",

    "5. **Final Encoded Dataset**: Combine the encoded categorical columns with the numerical columns (age, monthly charges, tenure) to create the final encoded dataset that's ready for use in machine learning models.\n",
