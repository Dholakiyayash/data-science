    "\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is used for discrete random variables. It provides the probability of a specific outcome occurring in a discrete set of possible outcomes.\n",

    "The PMF is defined as follows:\n",

    "Example of PMF:\n",
    "\n",
    "tossing a fair coin. its have 2 outcome Head and Tail.\n",

    "The PDF provides the probability density at each specific height value 'x', indicating the likelihood of an individual's height falling within a narrow range around that value. However, unlike the PMF, the PDF does not directly give the probability of any specific individual having exactly a particular height, as the probability of a single point in a continuous distribution is infinitesimally small. Instead, probabilities are calculated for intervals of values using integration over the PDF."

    "Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "normal distribution is one of the most commonly used probability distributions in statistics and is widely applied in various fields. It is used as a model in situations where data tends to cluster around a central value with symmetrically decreasing probabilities as we move away from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "Test Scores: In educational testing, the scores of a large group of students on a well-designed exam tend to follow a normal distribution. The majority of students score around the mean, and the number of students scoring much higher or lower gradually decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement Errors: When measuring physical quantities, such as length or weight, measurement errors often follow a normal distribution. The errors are symmetrically distributed around the true value, with more precise measurements having smaller errors.\n",

    "IQ Scores: Intelligence quotient (IQ) scores in the general population often approximate a normal distribution. The majority of people have IQ scores near the average, and the probabilities of extremely high or low IQ scores decrease as we move away from the mean.\n",

    "**Parameters of the Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). These parameters play a crucial role in shaping the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (μ): The mean represents the central value of the distribution. It is the average value around which the data clusters. Shifting the mean to the left or right moves the entire distribution along the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data points around the mean. A smaller standard deviation results in a narrower and taller distribution, while a larger standard deviation leads to a wider and flatter distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the mean sets the center of the distribution, and the standard deviation controls the spread of the data around the mean. Together, these parameters determine the shape of the normal distribution. A higher standard deviation results in a more spread-out distribution, while a smaller standard deviation leads to a more tightly clustered distribution."

It states that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. This holds true as long as certain conditions are met.\n",
