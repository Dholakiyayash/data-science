    "Definition: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of test scores for a class: [70, 75, 80, 85, 90]. The range is 90 - 70 = 20, indicating that the spread of scores is 20 points.\n",

    "Example: Suppose we have a dataset of exam scores: [80, 85, 90, 95]. The mean is (80 + 85 + 90 + 95) / 4 = 87.5. The variance is calculated as the average of squared deviations from the mean: ((80-87.5)^2 + (85-87.5)^2 + (90-87.5)^2 + (95-87.5)^2) / 4 = 25.625.\n",

    "\n",
    "Skewness is an important concept in statistics because it provides valuable insights into the shape and characteristics of the data distribution. It affects the interpretation of the data and the choice of appropriate statistical methods for analysis. For example, in the presence of skewness, the mean may not be the best measure of central tendency, and median might be a more robust choice. Understanding skewness helps analysts make informed decisions about data transformations and adjustments for accurate modeling and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive Skewness (Right Skewness): In a positively skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution extends more to the right, and the majority of the data points are clustered on the left side of the mean. The mean is usually greater than the median in positively skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative Skewness (Left Skewness): In a negatively skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution extends more to the left, and the majority of the data points are clustered on the right side of the mean. The mean is usually less than the median in negatively skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero Skewness: A distribution is considered to have zero skewness when it is perfectly symmetrical, and the mean, median, and mode are all equal."

    "covariance and correlation are used to understand the relationship between variables and to make predictions. However, correlation is preferred over covariance when comparing datasets with different scales, as correlation's standardized scale makes it easier to interpret and compare across different contexts. Correlation is widely used in fields such as finance, economics, social sciences, and data analysis to identify and quantify relationships between variables and to assess the strength of those relationships.\n",

    "Covariance is used to understand the direction of the relationship between two variables. However, it does not provide information about the strength of the relationship or how well the variables are related.\n",

    "Correlation is commonly used to assess the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It provides a standardized measure that allows for comparison across different datasets. High positive (near +1) or high negative (near -1) correlations indicate strong linear relationships, while correlations close to zero indicate weak or no linear relationship.\n"
