    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically \n",
    "in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases:\n",
    "SQL is  relational database management system.Because it’s designed to process millions of queries and thousands of transactions, MySQL is a popular choice for ecommerce businesses that need to manage multiple money transfers. On-demand flexibility is the primary feature of MySQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases:\n",
    "A NoSQL, or nonrelational database, allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated (in contrast to a relational database, which defines how all data inserted into the database must be composed). NoSQL databases grew popular as web applications became more common and more complex.\n"
