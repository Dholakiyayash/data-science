    "Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes\n",
    "simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run \n",

    "\n",
    "Multithreading allows the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. These parts are \n",
    "known as threads and are lightweight processes available within the process. So multithreading leads to \n",
