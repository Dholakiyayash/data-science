    "**Q1  Explain the following with an example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Artificial intelligence :\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. It involves the development of systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and learning from experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A common example of AI is a virtual personal assistant like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa. These systems can understand spoken language, respond to questions, set reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Machine learning :\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task over time. Instead of being explicitly programmed, machine learning algorithms allow systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An example of machine learning is a spam email filter. Instead of manually writing rules to detect spam, a machine learning algorithm can be trained on a dataset of emails, both spam and non-spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Deep learning :\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is a specialized subfield of machine learning that deals with neural networks containing multiple layers (deep neural networks). It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's interconnected neurons. Deep learning has proven very effective in tasks involving large amounts of complex data, such as image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An application of deep learning is image recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning architecture, can automatically learn to identify features like edges, textures, and shapes in images. For instance, a deep learning model trained on thousands of images of cats and dogs can learn to distinguish between these animals based on the patterns it detects in the images' pixels."

The process involves identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm or expected behavior. Common approaches include clustering, where anomalies are isolated due to their distinctness, and density estimation techniques, which pinpoint areas of low data density as potential anomalies.

By leveraging unsupervised methods, anomaly detection can be effective in scenarios where labeled anomaly data is limited or absent.\n",
