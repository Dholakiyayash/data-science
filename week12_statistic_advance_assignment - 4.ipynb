    "\n",
    "Sample Size: The primary difference between a t-test and a z-test is the sample size. A t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown. A z-test is used when the sample size is larger and the population standard deviation is known or can be reasonably estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: In a t-test, the sample standard deviation is used to estimate the population standard deviation. In a z-test, the population standard deviation is either known or assumed to be known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution: A t-test uses the t-distribution, which has heavier tails compared to the standard normal distribution (z-distribution). The t-distribution becomes closer to the z-distribution as the sample size increases.\n",

    "Example scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "T-Test Example:\n",
    "Let's say a pharmaceutical company wants to test if a new drug reduces blood pressure. They randomly select 20 patients and measure their blood pressure before and after taking the drug. Since the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown, a paired t-test would be appropriate to determine if there's a significant difference in blood pressure before and after taking the drug.\n",

    "Z-Test Example:\n",
    "Suppose an online retailer wants to compare the average purchase amount of customers who visit their website on weekends and weekdays. They collect purchase data from a large sample of customers. Since the sample size is large and the retailer has a good estimate of the population standard deviation, they can use a z-test to determine if there's a significant difference in the average purchase amount between the two groups."
